# Pattern B: Workflow (Single Process)
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your values

# AWS region for Lambda and API Gateway
aws_region = "us-east-1"

# OpenAI API key (required)
# Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
openai_api_key = "sk-your-api-key-here"

# OpenAI model (default: gpt-4o-mini - fast and cheap)
openai_model = "gpt-4o-mini"

# Lambda configuration
lambda_timeout     = 30  # seconds - allows for OpenAI API latency
lambda_memory      = 256 # MB - sufficient for FastAPI + OpenAI calls
log_retention_days = 7   # days - keep costs low for demo
